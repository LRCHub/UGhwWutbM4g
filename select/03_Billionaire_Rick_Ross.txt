Trilla

Boss
I done took over the game nigga
Hoppin' out the Bugatti with my Ballys on
No underwear nigga
My jeans tight fitted too nigga
Jay-Z, wuddup nigg?
Yeah, let me fuck with 'em right now

Niggas want to kidnap
Leave me in the trunk, walk away with big stacks
They jealous of the fortune
Glitz and the fame; a cocaine mortgage
In the game like Tony Parker
Snow White Range let my partner park it
I'm back on them thangs that's my only problem
Homie I put that on my only Mama (Mama)
Still rollin' with the fo' fifth
Now that I'm rich got these broke niggas so sick
And my daughters college pre-paid, she straight
Say thanks to the D game
In that phantom on that Tupac
Ridin' through the ghetto like I'm lookin' for a new spot (Not)
But I'm well established
I fuck with heroin 'cause it sells the fastest

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire (Boss)

A bitch try to stick me
'Cause you fuck me don't mean you can kiss me (naw)
I only fuck with the OG's
The ones that won't turn you in to the police
On the run, I'm thru' wit nigga four keys
ID's, passports, it was so sweet (Good looking nigga)
Front yard still a car show
Bugatti, the Gotti of Morocco
I won't let the roof up
Kingdom come, Prince of Zamunda
To be loved, to be loved
Oh, what a feeling for me to be loved
Haters want to murder me and I can smell a hit
So it's music to my ears every time I feel a clip
I'm a card shark up in the Hard Rock
Twenty grand a hand, baby, jamin' the ipod

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

Hit a hundred grand in a day damn
Whip that white girl just like K-Fed
Got me a white girl, I fuck till her face red
Yeah, her food tastes bad, but she give me great head
Please, let me say that, I really love her fat ass
Send her to the dealership, and she can, she can get that
My heart in the ghetto, I'm married to the projects
I ride with AR, in case a nigga start shit

I'ma ride 'bout mine and I wouldn't tell a lie
Take it out of town go and get my money right
And if it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire
If it ain't 'bout cash, I don't really care
I'm straight 'bout cash, I'm a hood billionaire

Triple C, we unstoppable
Told you all niggas in '95, I was worth two million
Now it's '08 and I got ten in the bank nigga
